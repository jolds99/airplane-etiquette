This repository contains the R scripts, csv data files and pdf final report of a group project conducted in November and December 2020 by Quinn Jonnson and Jonathan Olds. This project was used to fulfill a major class requirement in STAT 305 - Sampling Methods.
The project used a survey conducted by Walter Hickey from the website FiveThirtyEight in which the flight behaviors and perceptions of those behaviors of 1,041 airline travellers were examined. Our goal with the project was to answer the following four research questions using various statistical methods. 

** Q1: Are parents that currently have children under the age of 18 more tolerant of babies or unruly children on airplanes? **
** Q2: Is the height of an individual a clear indicator for his/hers likelihood to recline an airplane seat? **
** Q3: Is there a relationship between the frequency with which a person flies, and the number of behaviors they consider as rude? **
** Q4: How does an individualâ€™s gender and age affect their opinion of who can claim a shared armrest on an airplane? **

I (Jonathan) am responsible for the work and outputs (.pdf files) of the q1.R and q3.R scripts, as well as the corresponding written sections in the final project report (Final Report.pdf)
